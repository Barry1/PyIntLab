# PyIntLab

Python Interval Laboratory

For computing with uncertain values.
It should enable us to see the influence to the result and it's unvertainty.

For a small example just run `python src/pyintval/scalar_interval.py`.
Just given limited knowledge on pi you'll see, what happens.
For example for the diameter.
